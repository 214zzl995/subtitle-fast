# Project Instructions

- Run tests using `cargo run --release` before final delivery unless otherwise specified.
- Keep Rust code concise and effective; avoid unnecessary abstractions or boilerplate.
- When expanding functionality that may require future backends, expose capabilities through extendable interfaces or traits to preserve flexibility.
